# AITom

AITom is a library for developping AI algorithms for cellular electron cryo-tomography analysis. Developped and maintained by [Xu lab](https://cs.cmu.edu/~mxu1) and collaborators. 

Part of the code was adapted from an [extended version](http://web.cmb.usc.edu/people/alber/Software/mpp/) of the [tomominer library](https://github.com/alberlab/tomominer).
